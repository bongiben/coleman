Coleman Project Space is pleased to reopen with Real Time, a group exhibition of works observed from life by artists who employ a range of strategies to tweak the view. In this odd moment, the realities they speak of appear to embody a similar sense of shift, between perfunctory and less definable states of play. While some works propose a pictorial means of escape, others alert us to the curious and overlooked details of ordinary life revealed when the area of focus becomes small.

The exhibition includes works in a variety of media that refer to aspects of the painterly process. All have been made in plain sight of their sources and involve significant time investment. This might be hours in the studio, or journeys undertaken – from rabbit-hole research routes through art and other histories, to real-life dérives – that are essential to their manufacture.

Curated by Rebecca Geldard for CPS, the project will run concurrently in the gallery and via her arts and humanities site [appleandhat.com](http://appleandhat.com/).

Neil Gall lives and works in London. His works are placed in the collections of Denver Art Museum, The Morgan Library & Museum, New York, Zabludowicz Art Trust, Aberdeen City Art Gallery, Scotland, David Roberts Arts Foundation, London, Christen Sveaas Art Collection, Oslo, British Museum, London, Leeds City Art Gallery and other prominent international private collections.
